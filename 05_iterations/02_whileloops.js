/* A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement
 looks as follows:
    while (condition)
    statement
*/

let i = 1; //this is initialization of variables
while(i<=9){ //condition or terminator
    console.log(i)
    i++ // increaments of variable so loops runs repeatedly
}

//same as for loops we can break the loops here
